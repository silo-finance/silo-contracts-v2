/// @notice Interface for the Dynamic Kink Interest Rate Model
/// @dev This interface defines an adaptive interest rate model that dynamically adjusts rates based on market
///      utilization.
///      The model uses a "kink" mechanism where interest rates change more aggressively as utilization increases.
///      Unlike static models, this implementation adapts over time to market conditions.
/// 
///      Key Features:
///      - Dynamic rate adjustment based on utilization thresholds
///      - Time-based rate evolution to prevent sudden spikes
///      - Configurable parameters for different market conditions
///      - Compound interest calculation for accurate accrual
/// 
///      The model operates with several utilization zones:
///      - Low utilization (0 to ulow): Minimal rates to encourage borrowing
///      - Optimal range (u1 to u2): Stable rates for normal operations  
///      - High utilization (u2 to ucrit): Increasing rates to manage risk
///      - Critical utilization (ucrit to 1e18): Maximum rates
