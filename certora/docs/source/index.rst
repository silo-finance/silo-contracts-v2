.. The main table of contents, possible options:
   :maxdepth: integer - determines how many nested levels to show in the table
   :numbered: integer - add numbering for parts, the number deterrmines how many
   nested levels will be numbered
   See https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-toctree

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :numbered: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   ./customer
   ./high
   ./silo_props
   ./misc

.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   genindex
